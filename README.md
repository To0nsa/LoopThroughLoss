[View on Itch.io](https://to0nsa.itch.io/loopthroughloss)

**LoopThroughLoss** is a first-person narrative game exploring the emotional journey through grief, developed during a game jam organized by students at Hive Helsinki. The theme of the jam was **"Time Loop"**.

This short psychological experience takes you through looping inner thoughts, representing the five stages of grief:  
**Denial**, **Anger**, **Bargaining**, **Depression**, and **Acceptance**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

The game reuses the raycasting engine from my [Cub3D](https://github.com/To0nsa/cub3d), adapted to work with the powerful [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) graphics library.  
While the rendering was based on existing techniques, the team focused their efforts on:

- Game logic and mechanics  
- Atmosphere and emotional storytelling  
- Custom textures and sound design
